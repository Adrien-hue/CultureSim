During a business trip preceding his renewed mission, he contacts his old Chinese friend and former colleague with whom he has worked 15 years ago at the beginning of the now very successful joint venture. Mr. Guo is meanwhile employed by another company, but still lives in Beijing. Mr. Bakker is looking forward to meeting Guo, almost sentimentally he thinks back to the old days. They would have a lot to tell each other! Of course, Mr. Bakker has left the choice of the restaurant to Mr. Guo, and the latter had not foregone the opportunity to pick him up at the hotel. The limousine in which Guo drives up shows that Guo was successful. A warm welcome, true enthusiasm. During the journey, Guo tells who else he has invited. Actually, Mr. Bakker had been prepared for a dinner for two, but now the meeting seems to take place on a bigger scale. Some of the names Guo enumerates are absolutely unknown to Mr. Bakker. And he can hardly remember the shared experiences with them which Guo describes. Is Guo messing up memories? Mr. Bakker hardly gets the opportunity to say a word, because in between Guo is talking on his phone. Even more people seem to come to this meal, as Guo proudly points out. The restaurant is posh and the food is exquisite. But Mr Bakker is having an extremely exhausting evening. Afterwards he can hardly remember all the men with whom he had got acquaintance and with whom he had toasted to friendship, health, long life, success, respect and the like, who of them he knew before and who maybe not. But he was not even able to exchange three sentences in peace with Guo. Apparently the latter felt no need for it. So loud, hectic and noisy as the traffic in the streets of Beijing, so loud and noisy seemed the evening to Mr. Bakker. He doesn't really know what he should think of his friend Guo.",

Of course, also in China really good, personal friends meet with the two of them.",
                "comment":"This answer is not correct. If Guo would not have been interested in having a meeting with Mr. Bakker, he would certainly have come up with an excuse why he is prevented, and would not even have met with him. Inviting more guests can be only interpreted as a sign of appreciation of the relationship with Mr. Bakker, since Guo must have put some effort inviting many people and paying for exquisite food in this classy restaurant.",

From this perspective, Guo appears to be really interested in the friendship with Mr. Bakker. The expensive car in which he picks up Mr. Bakker and the choice of restaurant speaks just as much for it as the effort that Guo took in inviting guests.

Quality contacts with as many people as possible in China are very important and are viewed by the Chinese themselves as a kind of social capital for which one has to work.

It is also right that the maintenance of these networks is a costly and time-consuming affair, since it obliges to meet people in person. But it is wrong to interprete the given situation in such a way that Guo would like to make as little work as possible for maintaining his relationships. In China much importance is given to who dines with whom and in what ambiance. In that light a mass handling of his relations, as this answer suggests, would be perceived as very negative for Guo, especially by his Chinese guests.",

The wheel is mounted on a swing arm, which you can then loosen and fold back to get to the inner wheels. The Chinese employees had dismantled the entire wheel for this and the whole operation took more than two hours in total. Then I showed them how to repair it much easier and faster in half an hour. One week later I showed and explained it to them again. After further four weeks I happen to come back to the assembly hall and I see to my horror that they remove the entire wheel again, although I had already explained and shown it to them so often.\"",

This complete disregard for effectiveness and time may be a mentality which people adopted in the times when they were working in state enterprise. But the engineer cannot tolerate that everyone does their job as they please. That such a work ethic prevails, should give him food for thought. But it would be certainly premature to condemn the workers as lazy or disinterested. The reaons for their work attitude lie deeper, giving simple admonitions or simply pointing out alternatives is not sufficient.",

Assuming the engineer has shown the repair method in such a way that one or the other felt hurt in his pride, then the reaction might be (reinforced by the solidarity of the whole group) that they defiantly maintain their method according to the motto: \"Now even more we will do it in our way!\" And that they feel so struck, that they cannot anymore accept any advice. On the other hand, Chinese workers certainly know that the German engineer possesses more technical knowledge and skills than they have, and as their superior they have to obey his instructions. They probably know too the general political slogan \"Learn from abroad\"!",

They know for sure that in this way you can get the wheel running again and save yourself the experimentation with a new method of which you do not know whether this will achieve your goal. A certain shyness towards foreigners makes it more difficult to accept advice from him or, in the case of failure, to ask him for further advice.",
                "comment":"Continuing to use the old method poses the lower risk. In the long period of the socialist planned economy the importance of effectiveness and economic thinking, which is common in Western performance societies, was unknown and sometimes even considered suspicious. When the German engineer drops his advice while passing by or occasionally shows how to do it, he will hardly achieve any change in the traditional Chinese methods. It is not just that the sense for working ever faster and better is lacking. But above all the German engineer lacks the knowledge to deal in a correct way with the workers and this stands in the way of using the new method. The general reason for this may lie in the shyness towards foreigners. However, it is also in the power of the foreigner to do something about this shyness or distance. The brief the workers just in a factual and technical way in the new process will not create any human bridges. Here effectiveness has to wait for a moment. Here more attention must be paid to the personal experiences and needs of workers as people from a distant culture (whereby our culture is just as remote from them and needs just as much mediation). Only when these conditions are created, the timidity and distance can be reduced, advice can be accepted more easily, even if their implementation should fail in a first attempt and make it necessary to ask more questions. Assuming that the engineer has conveyed his explanations in this factual way, it is quite possible that his instructions have still not been understood.

        "context":"Ms. Koopmans tells the following story about her time at the Shanghai office:\n\"One day Anny Huang ran up to me fully excited and said there was a problem with the HEDI delivery. Anny Huang has worked as a buyer for more than 15 years for our company and is considered an \"old hand\". I was barely three months there. She was leading the team responsible for strategic purchasing. \"What problem?\" \"The fans cannot be loaded tomorrow,\" replied Anny Huang shortly. \"Why not?\" I asked astonished. I had myself signed for the order more than two months ago. And the supplier was considered as very reliable. If there were any delivery problems, he would have reported. I asked Ms. Li to come in the office, who is responsible for booking the containers. Had she forgotten to order the containers on time? She shrugged disinterestedly, then looked up the booking confirmation of the forwarding company and put them on the table without saying a word.\n\"So what did the supplier say? Why can’t he load tomorrow?\" Anny was silent. \"Why not? We have ordered two months ago! So?\" I really wanted to know what the reasons were, but got no answer. Instead Anny only briefly confirmed that the order had been written in time. Only when I sorted out the process myself, I found out that no order confirmation had been received from the supplier.\nAfter the freight forwarder one day earlier had sent the containers I had ordered to the supplier, an astonished employee of the supplier reported himself to Anny, because there was no current order. Anny tried now: \"I've already asked when they can deliver. But ...\"\nA little later Anny and I got in the car and drove to the supplier. I think if I hadn't taken care of it myself, we couldn't have shipped the goods in time.\"\nWhat has happened here and how would you act?",

        ],
        "explanation":"According to the Chinese understanding, the employee had given subtle, but sufficient information on the facts. Her excitement and the statement that she had written the order in time were enough information to understand that she had made a mistake and now only the boss could save things. It's not uncommon in China that existing problems or conflicts are not referred to directly, but are only pointed out by means of non-verbal signs, such as gestures and facial expressions, or through incomplete or encrypted statements. It is also not uncommon, that an employee does not take any initiative and proposes concrete solutions.\nThe sole decision-making competence and responsibility lies with the superior. Hence it is right that only she could personally solve the problem. It was of benefit to take Anny Huang with her in the car.\nHer long-term relationship with the supplier, the so called Guanxi, made it more easy to start negociations for Ms. Koopmans. With the help of a clear work organization, the problem outlined above can be avoided. Ms. Koopmans was apparently new and certainly relied on the routine and precision of her colleague Anny Huang. In China, however, a team leader must strictly see to it, that he carries out his control tasks . Ms. Koopmans should have paid, already in her induction period, more attention to all orders, that means she should have discussed with the employees and controlled one by one all the steps in the process. Doing so she would have had the opportunity to build up relationships and mutual trust. Because bosses in China are personal role models. Anny Huang works for the person Ms. Koopmans, whom she expects to guide her accordingly. This idea corresponds at least to the Confucian tradition.\nBosses are also figures of integration. Consequently Ms. Koopmans had had to make sure that the communication about the individual responsibilities would be clear. Ms. Li would only have ordered the containers, after the confirmation of the supplier had come in. So she had not have to be involved in the problem, and this would have saved her colleague Anny Huang from an extra embarrassment. But apart from all tasks and the associated rules and commitments, the employees expect from their superior that he personally takes the lead when a conflict or a problem arises. In general: even more important than clear defined work instructions is a regulating and directive authority figure."
